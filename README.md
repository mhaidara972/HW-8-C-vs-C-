**PURPOSE OF SOFTWARE:**
This project implements basic matrix operations (addition, multiplication, scalar multiplication, transpose) in both C++ and C. The C++ version utilizes object-oriented principles, while the C version provides a library of functions.

**FILES:**
* matrix.cpp: C++ source code implementing a Matrix class with matrix operations.
* matrix.c: C source code implementing a library of functions for matrix operations (C99 standard).
**BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:**
**C++:**
1.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
2.  Compile the C++ code using g++:  g++ matrix.cpp -o matrix_cpp

**C:**
1.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
2.  Compile the C code using gcc with the C99 standard:  gcc -std=c99 matrix.c -o matrix_c

**TESTING METHODOLOGY:**
The main function in both matrix.cpp and matrix.c contains a simple demonstration of the implemented matrix operations. To test, compile and run the respective executables. The output on the console will show the result of these operations. 

**ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:**
* The C implementation adheres to the C99 standard as requested.
